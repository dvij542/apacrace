# Adaptive Planning and Control with Time-Varying Tire Models for Autonomous Racing Using Extreme Learning Machine

## Hardware specifications

All experiments have been performed on AMD Ryzen 7 5000 series CPU with 16 GB RAM. For the RC car experiments, it is equipped with a Lidar, a depth dual camera, an IMU and wheel encoders. We however use the Vicon based localization to get an accurate position and orientation of the vehicle with high accuracy (of about 1 cm and 0.01 rad).

## Numerical simulation experiments 

We first present all the results from numeric simulation

### Tracks 

The tracks along with the racing lines used for the experiments are as follows :-
